# KickstartSolutions
Google Kickstart is a monthly competitive programming competition run by Google. These are my solutions to each round.
Although I do aim to complete as many problems as possible during each round I will also try to solve anything that I didn't get done during the round.

# Notes
Google Kickstart rounds last a couple of hours, So most of the code here was written as quickly as possible. As a result it is definitely not the cleanest or most readable code possible. So IDK just don't be expecting to read really nice stuff here.
